# todo-app-meteor
A simple todo application built with Metoer integrated with React.  
I held a live session with some of my colleagues where I tried my best explaining what Metoer is and how to use it(integrating it with React).
I wanted to ensure the session was very practical so we had a live coding session where I put all I have explained into practice by building a simple to-do applicaiton.   
This repository contains all the codes that we wrote during the coding session.
